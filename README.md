## Worked with Matt and Peter
Matt helped me get clarification on how to split everything up in their appropriate fields,
helped with getting my following button and unfollow working, also helped with displaying only user and followed users tweets on the homepage

used this site to reference how to combine querysets from the same model
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/431628/how-to-combine-two-or-more-querysets-in-a-django-view

Peter helped me figure out the logic to setup following and how to manipulate the manytomany field
