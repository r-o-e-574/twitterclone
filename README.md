## Worked with Matt, Peter, and Detrich
Matt helped me get clarification on how to split everything up in their appropriate fields,
helped with getting my following button and unfollow working, also helped with displaying only user and followed users tweets on the homepage

used this site to reference how to combine querysets from the same model

Peter helped me figure out the logic to setup following and how to manipulate the manytomany field


Detrich helped me get my notifications setup and going whenever a user is @ in a tweet

Referenced this code to get a character counter to display how many characters are left for user to tweet
